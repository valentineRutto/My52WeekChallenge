Question: 52 Week Challenge

The 52 Week Savings Challenge is a money saving challenge that spans over the course of 52 weeks.

On week 1 you save a minimum of Ksh.50, on week 2 you save Ksh.100 and so on until week 52 where you save Ksh. 2,600. If you successfully follow the challenge you will end up with Ksh. 68,900 at the end of the year.

Join the fun and let’s help you achieve your goals. It’s that simple!

Create an android app that allows a user to track their savings per week allowing the user to set a starting amount, default of Ksh. 50. The app should allow a user to update the initial value and view the changes per week automatically.

 The app should basically have an input field for the starting amount, and a list of weeks, with the savings amount per week.
